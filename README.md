# Netflix-Recommendation-System
Netflix Recommendation System predicting user preferences and suggesting movies using collaborative filtering in Python.

# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Recommendation System using SVD

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project builds a personalized recommendation system that predicts user ratings for unseen movies using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** â€” a collaborative filtering approach. The goal is to enhance user engagement by providing accurate and relevant content suggestions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To design a recommendation model that suggests movies to users based on their past preferences, improving user experience and retention.

## ðŸ§  Approach
- Loaded and preprocessed the **Netflix movie ratings dataset**.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand userâ€“movie interactions and rating trends.  
- Applied **SVD-based matrix factorization** using the **Surprise** library to predict unknown ratings.  
- Evaluated model performance using **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** and visualized rating distributions.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Surprise  
- **Techniques:** Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization (SVD), Recommender Systems  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- The SVD model efficiently captured userâ€“item relationships, improving prediction accuracy.  
- Users with consistent rating behavior contributed more to model stability.  
- Discovered how recommendation accuracy varies across genres and activity levels.

## ðŸš€ Results
- Achieved a **low RMSE value**, indicating reliable prediction performance.  
- Generated personalized movie recommendations for individual users.  
- Demonstrated the potential of matrix factorization for large-scale recommendation systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in Repository
- `Netflix_recommendation_system.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and analysis.  
- `README.md` â€“ this documentation.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization
- Rating distribution graphs.  
- Actual vs. Predicted rating plots.  
- User recommendation samples generated from the trained model.

## ðŸ§© Future Work
- Integrate **content-based filtering** to enhance hybrid recommendations.  
- Deploy model via **Streamlit** for interactive recommendation demos.
